% An industrial furnace is supported by a brick column with a cross-section of 1 m × 1 m.
% During steady-state operation, the furnace setup ensures that three faces of the column are maintained at 500 K,
% while the remaining face is exposed to an air stream at 300 K, with a heat transfer coefficient of h = 10 W/m²K.
% Determine the temperature map across the column's cross-section and the heat power dissipated into the air per unit length of the column.
% Density = 1920 kg/m^3; Thermal conductivity = 0.72 W/m/K; Specific heat = 835 J/kg/K
