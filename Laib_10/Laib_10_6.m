% A straight fin with a constant cross-section is made of a material with thermal conductivity k = 50 W/m/K,
% thickness w = 6 mm, and length L = 48 mm. It is very long in the direction perpendicular to the figure.
% The convective heat transfer coefficient is h = 500 W/m²/K, and the ambient air temperature is Ta = 30°C.
% The base of the fin is maintained at a constant temperature of Tb = 100°C, while the tip is perfectly insulated.

% a. Using the finite difference method, estimate the temperature distribution along the fin.
% Is the assumption of one-dimensional heat transfer reasonable for this fin?

% b. Estimate the heat dissipated by the fin per unit length normal to the figure [W/m].

% c. Using the mesh from part (a), calculate and plot the temperature distribution for h = 10, 100, 500, and 1000 W/m²/K.
