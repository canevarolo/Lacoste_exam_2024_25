# Lacoste_exam_2024_25

Solutions of problems of "Computational Heat Transfer" course from Energy Engineering in Politecnico di Torino for the year 2024/25.
The term "Lacoste" is the nickname of the italian name of this exam ("Laboratorio COmputazionale di Scambio TErmico") and has nothing to do with... bags or polos. :)
The reason why there is a repository for each year is because requests, and so codes, change throughout the years.

The files are developed in MatLab language, charged in .m .
For any mistakes or add-ins, just contact me.

The language used is english, even though there could be some comments or expressions in italian (language of the course).
