% A superconducting filament (diameter D = 0.81 mm, length L = 1 m, diffusivity alpha = 11e-5 m^2/s,
% thermal conductivity k = 350 W/m/K), initially at 4.5 K, carries a current I = 50 A.
% The electric field generated by the current while the filament is in a superconducting state is
% E = E0 (I/IC)^n
% where E0 = 1e-5 V/m and n = 1.2.
% IC is the critical current (i.e., the maximum current that can be carried by the conductor
% in the superconducting state), which decreases as the temperature increases: IC = 50 - T^2.
% The ends of the filament are maintained at 4.5 K. Numerically calculate the temperature
% rise up to t = 15000 s using the backward Euler method.
% Plot the time evolution of the volumetric power and the temperature evaluated at the midpoint of the filament.
