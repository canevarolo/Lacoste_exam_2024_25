% In the same case of the exercise 1 (an infinite wall with 50 mm of thinkness and heat conducibility
% of 500 W/m/K and volumetric heat generation of 500 kW/m^3), the insulation is removed from the adiabatic surface,
% so that surface A is in contact with a fluid at temperature 273 K with which it exchanges
% heat by convection (heat transfer coefficient h_f = 100 W/(mÂ² K)), see Fig. 4.
% Calculate analytically and numerically the temperature distribution in the wall,
% verify the incoming and outgoing heat fluxes, and compare the two solutions on the same graph.
